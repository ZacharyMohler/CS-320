# CS-320 Software Test Automation & QA

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Within the scope of this class, we learned to write test cases that ensure a program is functional as per requirements. We did this by writing an exhaustive list of test cases and reviewing the code coverage of the written test cases. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs may be readily apparent or more obscure. It is simple to say, "requirements as requested by the client/user are incorporated". But sometimes you need to read between the lines and adjust what the client/user may need. For example, in the contact service application, I implemented a number of getters and setters not explicitly requested in the client requirements. These requirements were necessary to complete the main requirements, but their own requirement was not so obvious. It should be noted that constant communication with the client on their current wishes for a program is imperative to the success of a project.

## How do I approach designing software?
I usually approach the design of software with the idea that proposed requirements should be the first guide, then user needs and security, with other features being last in the hierarchy.
